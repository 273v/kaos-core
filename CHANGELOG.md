## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0a1] — 2026-05-04

First public alpha release.

### Added

- Foundational runtime, MCP-native types, registries, and execution engine
  for the KAOS (Kelvin Agentic Operating System) platform.
- `KaosRuntime` container with explicit dependency injection (`KaosRuntime.default()`
  for scripts and tests; explicit construction for library code).
- Tool, resource, prompt, and namespace registries with provenance tracking.
- `KaosContext` execution context with session/trace correlation.
- `ModuleSettings` typed-settings base class with six-level resolution
  (overrides → context → environment → `.env` → field defaults).
- `SecretStr`-aware `resolve_secret()` for credential resolution from
  settings, environment variables, or the `CredentialStore` file backend.
- Three-tier artifact policy (inline / summary / handle) with thresholds
  `INLINE_THRESHOLD = 16 KB` and `SUMMARY_THRESHOLD = 256 KB`.
- Disk-first virtual filesystem (`VirtualFileSystem`) with memory and disk
  backends, range reads, pagination, and lazy loading.
- Agent primitives: `SamplingRequest`, `ElicitationRequest`,
  `DelegationRequest`, `TaskManager`.
- `WorkflowExecutor` and `ExecutionEngine` for composable execution.
- Structured logging via `kaos_core.logging.get_logger()` with auto-prefix
  to the `kaos.*` hierarchy.
- 10 built-in MCP tools registered via `register_core_tools()`.
- CLI entrypoints `kaos-core` (administrative) and `kaos-core-serve`
  (MCP server).
- Python 3.13 and 3.14 support.
